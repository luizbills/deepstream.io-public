# Public deepstream.io server

A simple repository to facilitate the deployment or testing of a deepstream.io server.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/luizbills/deepstream.io-public ds
cd ds
npm i
npm run start
```

Done! Now your deepstream server is running in `localhost:6020`.

> On some platforms (such as [fly.io](https://fly.io)) you may need to change the PORT to 3000. Make this change in "scripts" in the [package.json](/package.json).
